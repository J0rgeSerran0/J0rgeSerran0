### Hi there, how are you doing :wave:

My name is **Jorge Serrano** and I live in **[Madrid (Spain)](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Madrid/@40.4381311,-3.8196213,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd422997800a3c81:0xc436dec1618c2269!8m2!3d40.4167754!4d-3.7037902)**.

I have been awarded as **Microsoft MVP** during 16 years (2001-2017), I love the technology and help to others.

I have published videos and courses, written more than 10 books and more than 100 articles for specialized magazines in the past.

At present, I am coordinator of an [User Group - MsCoders](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/MSCoders/#), and I write technical posts on my [blog](https://geeks.ms/jorge/), sharing and **always learning**!

### :point_right: Today

I'm currently working on **[OCU Consumidores](https://www.ocu.org/)**, an Organisation of Consumers and Users.

There I work with different technologies, most of them related with Microsoft (.NET Core, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Office 365, etc).

My rol is a multidisciplinary rol, with a strong team work with high responsibility and in an experienced team, however I like to say that I am **Developer**!
